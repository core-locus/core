# Building
We are using the (premake)[https://github.com/premake/premake-core/wiki/] build system to target development on Windows, MacOS and Linux

To generate build files on MacOS run from project root:
```
./vendor/bin/premake/premake5 gmake2 && make
```

You can run the sample project with:
```
./bin/Debug-macosx-x86_64/Sandbox/Sandbox
