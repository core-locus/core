# Core
core game engine for upcoming voxel based game

# Building
We currently support building for Linux and MacOS with plans to add support for windows (as soon as we figure out how)

For now, you can target the current platform with:
```
$ ./build.sh
```

If you would also like to output for the current executable use:
```
$ ./build-and-run.sh
```

For Linux:
```
$ ./build.sh (-tp|--target-platforms) Linux
```
and to run:
```
$ ./build-and-run.sh (-tp|--target-platforms) Linux
```
